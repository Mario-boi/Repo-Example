    <p>This is the first page of HTML written in DES 327 Interactive Design 1. Here we can see the content and ideas we must collect before desiging a page as well as the underlying structure that sends this content across the web - HTML. The final element we will explore on this document is basic customization in CSS.</p>

    <h3><b>From the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C)Definitions</b></h3>
    
    <p>HTML: "HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:</p>

<ul class="defs">
    <li>Publish online documents with headings, texts, tables, lists, photos, etc.</li>
    <li>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.</li>
    <li>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.</li>
    <li>Include spread-sheets, video clips, and other applications directly in their documents.</li>
</ul>

<h4>CSS: CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to:</h4>

<ul class="defs">
    <li>Adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers.</li>
    <li>CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML based markup language</li>
    <li>The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, anf tailor pages to different environments</li>
    <li>This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation</li>
</ul>
